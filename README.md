[00:04.26] Head to toe
[00:06.25] Inadequate
[00:08.53] Ready to go
[00:10.09] But so ill-equipped yeah
[00:13.55] I'm gonna take a walk anyway
[00:27.55] 
[00:17.79] I tread millions of miles a day
[00:23.32] Sow, reap, repeat
[00:25.54] I pave the way
[00:32.54] 
[00:31.78] You've been around the place a few times
[00:36.26] I find the pace pleasant and kind
[00:40.24] Now you've gone too far over the guideline
[00:44.74] I found my peace lagging behind
[01:00.24] 
[00:48.29] And every step I take is leading me
[00:51.85] To another bad decision
[01:03.35] 
[00:56.05] And so I walk away
[00:59.38] Walk, walk away
[01:01.52] Walking away from my demons
[01:05.81] Walk away
[01:07.81] Walk, walk away
[01:10.35] Walking away with a reason
[01:23.35] 
[01:12.76] Yeah I've been walking for years
[01:16.53] I'll never stop
[01:18.32] My feet never yield
[01:20.53] I'll come out on top
[01:30.53] 
[01:22.51] Mobility boomers
[01:24.78] Falling for trumours
[01:27.03] Devotional journeys
[01:31.04] On spiritual heelies
[01:41.04] 
[01:34.53] And every step I take is leading me
[01:38.59] To another bad decision
[01:50.09] 
[01:42.75] And so I walk away
[01:46.09] Walk, walk away
[01:48.34] Walking away from my demons
[01:52.59] Walk away
[01:54.58] Walk, walk away
[01:57.08] Walking away with a reason
[02:10.08] 
[01:59.58] And so I walk away
[02:03.00] Walk, walk away
[02:05.24] Walking away from my demons
[02:09.57] Walk away
[02:11.56] Walk, walk away
[02:14.06] Walking away with a reason
[02:27.06] 
[02:19.02] Oh and every step I take is leading me
[02:23.04] To another bad decision
[02:27.82] Yeah every step I take
[02:30.57] Every step I take
[02:32.21] Is fleeting
[02:37.71] 
[02:35.85] Oh and every step I take is leading me
[02:40.28] To another bad decision
[02:45.03] Yeah every step I take
[02:47.60] Every step I take
[02:49.26] Is fleeting
[02:54.76] 
[02:58.27] Walk away
[03:00.31] Walk, walk away
[03:02.78] Walking away from my demons
[03:07.07] Walk away
[03:08.89] Walk, walk away
[03:11.22] Walking away with a reason
[03:24.22] 
[03:15.31] Walk away
[03:17.23] Walk, walk away
[03:19.90] Walking away from my demons
[03:23.86] Walk away
[03:25.72] Walk, walk away
[03:28.23] Walking away with a reason
[03:41.23] 
[03:31.06] And so I walk away
[03:35.70] Walk away
